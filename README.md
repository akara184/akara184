        <p>Hellooo! <span>&#x1F44B;</span> My name is Davi and I am a student of Systems Analysis and Development with Java as my main stack. I have fluency in English and am looking to learn French. I'm really passionate about computer science, it's a hobby that I absolutely love. My favorite fields in this world are competitive programming, and I'm a newbie in compilers. I'm eager to learn new technologies, with Kotlin as my next programming language on the horizon, and later, I'd love to delve into compilers/interpreters.</p>
