        <p>Hellooo! <span>&#x1F44B;</span> My name is Davi and  I am a student of Systems Analysis and Development with Java as my main stack. I have fluency in English and am looking to learn French. I'm really passionate about computer science. My favorite fields in this world are competitive programming,functional programming and I'm a newbie in compilers. I'd love to delve into compilers, I would love to build one from scratch.</p>
